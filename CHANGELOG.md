## 1.0-dev0

### Added

- Plone

### Removed

- Jenkins

## Fixed

- Makefile and key-scan: Use sentinel file to indicate if it was run. Runs again if hosts file changes.
- Traefik default middlewares extended and catch-all http -> https redirects.

### Updated

- Traefik is updated to version 2.5

## PRE-FORK
### Added
- A separate `extra-vars.yml` file containing all needed variables to avoid being asked them during installation.
- A `Makefile` to easily run the needed commands.
- This changelog file to keep track of changes.

### Fixed
- Renamed `master` to `main` whenever possible.
- The main node is now specified in the variables, this avoids having to name your main node `main` or modifying the playbooks to replace main with the name of your node.
- Removed `ssh-keyscan.yml` from bootstrap, since this playbook should be run only once (if necessary).

### Updated
- Traefik is updated to version 2.4
- Portainer is updated to version 2.x
